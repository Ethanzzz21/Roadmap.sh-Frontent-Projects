# Single-Page-CV-Roadmap.sh-Project

This is my first project on Roadmap.sh, I am new to github but I'm pretty sure that this is how I do it.

To run the project, open up and IDE and run it using something like live server. That's how I do it, but if there's another way that I'm supposed to leave it as a finished product let me know.

This is the project I am doing:
