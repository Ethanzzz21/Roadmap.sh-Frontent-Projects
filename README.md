# Roadmap.sh Frontend Projects

This is a collection of projects that I am working on for the Roadmap.sh frontend roadmap, I am new to github but I'm pretty sure that this is how I do it.

To run the project, open up and IDE and run it using something like live server. That's how I do it, but if there's another way that I'm supposed to leave it as a finished product let me know.
